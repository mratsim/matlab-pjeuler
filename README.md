# Playground for functional programming in Matlab

Using Project Euler as a premise, (only first 4 pb)

I tried to keep the code as functional as possible :
*   no for loop (tough with fibonacci questions)
*   fight with Matlab "first-class" functions
*   a 'while' loop left, probably due to memory reason, or a lack of fold/dropWhile in Matlab

I wanted to refresh my Matlab-fu before using it for a huge biostatistics dataset to help my wife on her PhD.
Didn't go far as in the end I used Python!
